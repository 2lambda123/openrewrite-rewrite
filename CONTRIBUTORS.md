# Building & Developing OpenRewrite

We use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build this project.
The gradle wrapper checked into this project defines the gradle version to use.  
When building from the command line invoke the wrapper with `./gradlew build` on unix-style terminals and `gradlew build` on windows-style terminals.

NOTE: windows-style users should ensure that they configure `core.autocrlf = false` as Rewrite requires unix-style line endings. This can be done at clone time by using `git clone -c core.autocrlf=false https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite.git`.

### CLI Environment Configuration:

* [JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) version: 11
    * JDK language & bytecode level: 1.8
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) version: Defined in wrapper
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) version: 1.5
    * Kotlin language level: 1.5
    * Kotlin JVM bytecode level: 1.8

### IDE Configuration

We use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to develop this project.
Other IDEs or versions of this IDE can be made to work.
These are one set of versions we know works:

* IDEA version:  2021.1.3

You must set the `-parameters` compiler flag to run Rewrite tests.
If your system does not have UTF-8 as its default character encoding (e.g., Windows) you must also add `-encoding utf8`.
Add these to the "additional command line parameters" field in IntelliJ -> Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Java Compiler.
