name: org.openrewrite.gradle.search.EnableGradleParallelExecution
displayName: Enable Gradle parallel execution
description: Most builds consist of more than one project and some of those projects are usually independent of one another. Yet Gradle will only run one task at a time by default, regardless of the project structure. By using the `--parallel` switch, you can force Gradle to execute tasks in parallel as long as those tasks are in different projects. See the [Gradle performance documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/performance.html#parallel_execution) for more.
